# Vroom Car Shop

This project was built when I first started learning the MERN stack (React, MongoDB, Express & Node). This was the first larger project I worked on from scratch, without using some kind of prebuilt plugin or platform.

## About The Build

Building this ecommerce styled full-stack application was a great opportunity to familiarise myself with the core concepts I had been learning at the time such as: <br />

- Managing global state with Redux (Actions & Reducers) <br />
- Using redux state in components (useDispatch & useSelector) <br />
- Creating an extensive backend with JWT authentication and Google login functionality using Express <br />
- Working with a mongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM <br />
- Creating custom authentication middleware <br />
<br />
Some of the features provided in this application are:
<br /><br />

Play / pause <br />
Skip Forward / back <br />
View song length / time left <br />
Drag handler to change position in current song <br />
Song library to choose songs from <br />
Mobile responsive
