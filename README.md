# Vroom Car Shop

This project was built when I first started learning the MERN stack (React, MongoDB, Express & Node). This was the first larger project I worked on from scratch, without using some kind of prebuilt plugin or platform.

## About The Build

Some of the concepts this application has really helped me with: <br />

- Working with hooks such as useRef for capturing input values <br />
- Passing, drilling and destructuring props <br />
- Passing, lifting and modifying state <br />

<br />
Some of the features provided in this application are:
<br /><br />

Play / pause <br />
Skip Forward / back <br />
View song length / time left <br />
Drag handler to change position in current song <br />
Song library to choose songs from <br />
Mobile responsive
