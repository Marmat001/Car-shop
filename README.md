# Vroom Car Shop

This project was built when I first started learning the MERN stack (React, MongoDB, Express & Node). This was the first larger project I worked on from scratch, without using some kind of prebuilt plugin or platform.

## About The Build

Building this ecommerce styled full-stack application was a great opportunity to familiarise myself with the core concepts I had been learning at the time such as: <br />

- Managing global state with Redux (Actions & Reducers) <br />
- Using redux state in components (useDispatch & useSelector) <br />
- Creating an extensive backend with JWT authentication and Google login functionality using Express <br />
- Working with a mongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM <br />
- Creating custom authentication middleware <br />
<br />
Some of the features provided in this application are:
<br /><br />

- Custom database seeder script to insert development data <br />
- Shopping cart with PayPal and debit / credit card payment integration <br />
- Car reviews and ratings system <br />
- Carousel that displays latest additions <br />
- Page pagination <br />
- Car search feature <br />
- Car Inventory functionality with real time "in stock count" update <br />
- Login authentication system with email & password / Google login <br />
- User profile with order summaries and the ability to add / update profile picture <br />
- Admin area to manage orders, cars and customers. Some of the functionality included: Updating orders to approved / payed / delivered. Add / update / remove cars from website inventory. View all order details. Give admin rights to other users and create / remove user accounts <br />
- Ecommerce checkout process (shipping, payment method, etc) <br />
- Download / view order payment PDF for both customers and admins <br />
- Contact form with legitimate email dispatch on send <br />
- Keyframe transition animations on homepage and typewriter styled headings on shop page <br />
- Fully mobile responsive, both user and admin view, including data tables <br />
