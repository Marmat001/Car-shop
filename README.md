# Vroom Car Shop

This project was built when I first started learning the MERN stack (React, MongoDB, Express & Node). This was the first larger project I worked on from scratch, without using some kind of prebuilt plugin or platform.

## About The Build

Building this ecommerce styled full-stack application was a great opportunity to familiarise myself with the core concepts I had been learning at the time such as: <br />

- Managing global state with Redux (Actions & Reducers) <br />
- Using redux state in components (useDispatch & useSelector) <br />
- Creating an extensive backend with JWT authentication and Google login functionality using Express <br />
- Working with a mongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM <br />
- Creating custom authentication middleware <br />
<br />
Some of the features provided in this application are:
<br /><br />

Custom database seeder script to insert development data <br />
Shopping cart with PayPal and debit / credit card payment integration <br />
Car reviews and ratings system <br />
Carousel that displays latest additions <br />
Page pagination <br />
Car search feature <br />
Car Inventory functionality with real time "in stock count" update <br />
Login authentication system with email & password / Google login <br />

Mobile responsive
